    "description": "This heatmap was generated in February 2017 from Bucharest, Romania. It was captured with 3 RTL SDRs connected to wire antennas of different lengths. The heatmaps are actually on different layers and can be selected with button from the top left corner. Around 27MHz you can see some HAMs (radio amateurs) chatting. Between 88-108MHz you can clearly see the FM station. I don't know what the other signals are, but if you do, let us know so we can add it to the description.",

The heatmaps are actually on different layers and can be selected with button from the top left corner. Until 108MHz you can clearly see the FM stations, and between 166-174 MHz there is a lot of narrow FM taxi chatter. A huge amount of noise and some reflections can be observed at ~125MHz. Other small signals are very visible but that's enough spoilers.",

I think this is a DVB-t (digital TV) signal. There is another very interesting signal at the end of this spectrum but I have no idea what is this. Only one of the 3 dongles was able to receive it, perhaps because the antenna of the dongle that received this signal is horizontal.",

It was captured with 3 RTL SDRs connected to wire antennas of different lengths and with different orientations. At the end of this spectrum you can see a part of a signal where normally I would expect LTE, but it looks a bit strange for that. In the first part there is something that appears only on the first radio but I couldn't say for sure what is that.",
