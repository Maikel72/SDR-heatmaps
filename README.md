SDR Heatmaps
============

This repo will host high resolution **radio heatmaps** that can be easily viewed in a browser.

The key is to use the [Deep Zoom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Zoom) technology to generate tiles which would display only the visible parts of an image.
*It's similar to how Google Maps allows us to view all the world in a browser.*

### Usage:

1. Fork this repo and make a local clone
2. Copy your high resolution heatmap in the `highrez` directory
3. Edit `maps.json` and follow the example which is already in place
4. Run `generate.py` to generate the tiles, the .dzi images and .html files
5. Commit, push and submit pull request :)

If you can help identify some of the signals here let us know so we extend the description.
